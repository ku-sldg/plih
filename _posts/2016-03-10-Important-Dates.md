I have updated Project 2 to show a due date of March 24, the Thursday after Sprint Break ends.  If you wait to start your assignment until you get back the Monday before, you should still have plenty of time to finish.  Do look at the project before class on Tuesday, March 22nd.

I will answer questions about the project in class on March 22nd.  If you don't ask questions I can't answer them, so look through the project before you come to class.  If we spend the entire class answering project questions, I don't care.

We will have our midterm the week following your project submission.  Most likely Thursday, March 31 unless there is a compelling reason to move it to Tuesday the 29th.  We will review for the exam the class perioe before it is held.

Have a good Spring Break!
