title: Project 4 Posted
---
Project 4 is officially posted.  I am not taunting you while you're working on Project 3 - you guys asked me to post it.  You are not ready to do this project yet, but if you read ahead in our text you can figure it out.  I do not expect you to do that.  We'll go over everything you need in class just as we have in the past.

I've not set a due date.  We'll talk about that in class, but expect an "official" due date sometime right before finals week.  We'll talk about the "unofficial" due date as we wind up the semester.
