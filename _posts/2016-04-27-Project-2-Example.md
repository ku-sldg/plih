title: Project 2 Example
---
As promised in class, I'm proving a solution to [Project 2](http://palexand.github.io/eecs662/resources/cfwae-dynamic.rkt).  I've updated the project to implement this year's Project 2 based on an old implementation, so I'm reasonably confident in the code.  However, I'm not guaranteeing it is a perfect solution.

Please note that if you use this code directly in Project 3 or Project 4, you must say so in your documentation for those projects.  Citation is how we credit each other as academics, so always include references for other's work when you use it.
