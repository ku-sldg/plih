title: Project 2 Grading
---
Project 2 is officially graded.  Scores were very high - that's good!

As with Project 1, if you made multiple submissions I graded the last
one unless an earlier one got graded and you scored 100%.

Thanks to everyone who put test cases at the end of their files.  That
made grading much simpler, reducing the test cases I ran by hand.
