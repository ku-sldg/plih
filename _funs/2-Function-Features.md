## Strict vs. Lazy

## Currying

## DeBrujin Numbering

## Name Mangling

## Exercises

1. Many languages (Haskell included) allow both strict and lazy evaluation.  Define a new language that implements this feature by defining two versions of `App`, - `AppS` and `AppL`.  Do not worry about a concrete syntax.  Simply replace `App` in the abstract syntax and define a new `eval` function.
