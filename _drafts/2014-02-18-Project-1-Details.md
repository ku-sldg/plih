Several things related to Project 1 submission.  First, the cours
Blackboard page should now be online with a submission link for
Project 1.  Unfortunately, I can't see what you see on Blackboard and
have no idea what actually appears there.  Let me know if there are
any problems.

Second, I will hold office hours on Thursday even though we don't have
class with Expo happening.  Regular time in the regular place.

Third, the due date is February 25 at 11:59pm.  I'll update the
project page with this info.
