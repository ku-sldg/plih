title: Final Exam Topics
---
I have updated the final exam topics on the website.  We'll review
them in class, but if you want to start studying really, really early,
have at it.

Note that the final is in our classroom on 16 May, 1:30-4:00.  The
date and time are specified by KU, not me, or we would do it much
sooner in the week.
