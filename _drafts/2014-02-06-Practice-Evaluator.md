title: Practice Evaluator
---
To get started using DrRacket and writing evaluators, take the example
we did in class and add operations for multiply (`mult`) and negation
(`neg`).  Update the type definition and interpreter to include these
new operations.  As you do this, think about both what is different
about these operations and why this small language is not particularly
useful.  What is missing?
