title: Project 3 Posted
---
Project 3 is now posted in the Projects list.  As promised, it is
asking you to add static scoping and recursion to your last
interpreter.  I have not yet gotten a working version of my solution
to Project 2 posted, but will do that in the next few hours.
Tentative due date for Project 3 is going to be a week from Tuesday,
but we'll talk about that in class.
