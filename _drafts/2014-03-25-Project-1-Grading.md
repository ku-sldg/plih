title: Project 1 Grading
---
Quick note on grading for Project 1.  If you submitted multiple
attempts, I only graded your final attempt.  If you see a 0 on your
first attempt(s), ignore it.  Blackboard only keeps the highest graded
attempt.

I graded based on success and failure of my test cases.  One or two
failures will only result in a small deduction.  If you fail many test
cases or an entire test case associated with a language feature, then
your deduction will be more severe.

Grades should be rolling out.  Don't freak if you haven't seen yours
yet - I'm still working.
