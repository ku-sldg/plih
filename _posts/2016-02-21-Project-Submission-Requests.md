title: Project Submission Requests
---
Our grader has completed the first project and you should be seeing grades soon if not already.

He has a few requests concerning submissions that would simplify his life significantly:

* No RAR files.  RAR files can be really weird to deal with.  I've had significant problems with them in the past as well.
* Include your name and/or student ID in every file you submit.  If you submit multiple files, they are downloaded as separate files in the grading system.
* If you submit more than once, submit every file each time.  Each submissin is treated separately by the grading system.  Files from earlier submissions do not get included in later submissions.
