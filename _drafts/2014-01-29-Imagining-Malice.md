title: Imagining Malice
---
Just spent a great two days with other performers at the VET PI
meeting.  Our work with [Adventium Labs](http://www.adventiumlabs.com)
attempts to hypothesize what kinds of things could be done using a
computing appliance like a printer or router.  Our class is about
programming languages and I have worked with design languages for
years.  So what the heck does that have to do with malice in
refrigerators? 

As it turns out, plenty.  One investigator is using grammars to define
various kinds of attack sequences.  Several have languages for
describing system models.  Others languages for describing plans and
ways of exploring attack surfaces.  Several propose formal semantics
for models.   Our project with Adventium will include at least one
embedded language for describing system probes and another for
describing attack plans.  KU is working to develop the former and will
generate outputs for the latter.  Specifically, we will develop tools
that allow specification of things to look for in a system and
interpret those specifications to perform probing on specific
devices. A language and an interpreter, just like class except that we
generate test results rather than numbers. Languages are everywhere! 

I'm quit happy to talk about any of you about this project or even do
a presentation in class.  Just let me know if you are interested.
